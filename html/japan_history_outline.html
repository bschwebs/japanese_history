<h2 id='jōmon-period-c-14500-bce----c-300-bce'>Jōmon Period (c. 14,500 BCE – c. 300 BCE)</h2>
<h3 id='jōmon-period'><a href='./blog_posts/jomon_blog_post.html'>Jōmon period</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview &amp; culture:</strong>  Japan’s earliest known culture was the hunter‑gatherer <strong>Jōmon</strong> people.  The name <em>Jōmon</em> means <em>“cord‑marked”</em> and refers to the distinctive pottery patterns.  They lived in pit dwellings and relied on fishing, hunting and foraging.  Around <strong>900 BCE</strong> rice farming was introduced, marking a gradual shift toward agriculture.  Population expanded and by c. 3,000 BCE there were possibly hundreds of thousands of people.</li>
<li><strong>Important figures:</strong>  No specific rulers are recorded for this prehistoric era.</li>
<li><strong>Notable events:</strong>  Development of cord‑marked pottery; introduction of rudimentary agriculture toward the end of the period.</li>
<li><strong>Tragedies:</strong>  Evidence of natural disasters exists in the archaeological record (tsunami deposits), but no documented tragedies.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id='yayoi-period-c-300-bce----c-250-ce'>Yayoi Period (c. 300 BCE – c. 250 CE)</h2>
<h3 id='yayoi-period'><a href='./blog_posts/yayoi_blog_post.html'>Yayoi period</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview &amp; culture:</strong>  The <strong>Yayoi</strong> period saw the <strong>introduction of wet‑rice agriculture and metalworking</strong>.  Stone tools were gradually replaced by bronze and iron implements, irrigation techniques were developed and communal granaries appeared.  Populations grew and many settlements became large villages; the <strong>Asahi</strong> settlement covered about 200 acres.</li>
<li><strong>Important figures:</strong>  Early clan leaders; the period culminates with the semi‑legendary <strong>Queen Himiko</strong>, a shaman queen who ruled the state of <strong>Yamatai</strong> (Yamato) in the 3rd century and sent embassies to the Chinese <strong>Wei dynasty</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Important moments:</strong>  Introduction of rice agriculture and metal tools; emergence of social classes and early trading networks.</li>
<li><strong>Tragedies:</strong>  None documented; this era predates written records.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id='kofun-period-c-250----538'>Kofun Period (c. 250 – 538)</h2>
<h3 id='kofun-period'><a href='./blog_posts/kofun_blog_post.html'>Kofun period</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview &amp; culture:</strong>  Named after the <strong>kofun</strong> (large earthen burial mounds), this era marks the rise of the <strong>Yamato clan</strong>, who established control over central Japan and later formed the imperial lineage.  <strong>Shinto</strong> beliefs emerged and elaborate <strong>haniwa</strong> clay figures were placed around tombs.  New technologies—ironworking and improved irrigation—spread across the islands.</li>
<li><strong>Important figures:</strong>  Early emperors from the Yamato lineage (Emperor Sujin, Emperor Nintoku); <strong>Queen Himiko</strong> may overlap into this period.</li>
<li><strong>Important moments:</strong>  Construction of giant kofun tombs; formation of a centralised court under Yamato rule; emergence of Shinto rituals.</li>
<li><strong>Tragedies:</strong>  No specific tragedies recorded; conflicts between clans likely occurred.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id='asuka-period-538----710'>Asuka Period (538 – 710)</h2>
<h3 id='asuka-period'><a href='./blog_posts/asuka_blog_post.html'>Asuka period</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview &amp; culture:</strong>  Increased interaction with Korea and China brought <strong>Buddhism</strong> and Chinese governmental models.  <strong>Empress Suiko</strong> reigned with her nephew <strong>Prince Shōtoku</strong> as regent; Shotoku promoted Buddhism and issued a <strong>“Seventeen‑Article Constitution”</strong> to guide government.  After <strong>Fujiwara no Kamatari</strong> launched a coup in <strong>645</strong>, the <strong>Taika Reforms</strong> nationalised land and restructured administration along Chinese lines.  The period ended following the <strong>Jinshin Incident</strong> (671–672), when <strong>Emperor Tenmu</strong> purged rivals to secure succession.</li>
<li><strong>Important figures:</strong>  Empress <strong>Suiko</strong>, <strong>Prince Shōtoku</strong>, <strong>Fujiwara no Kamatari</strong>, <strong>Emperor Tenmu</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Important moments:</strong>  Introduction and patronage of Buddhism; Taika Reforms; adoption of Chinese-style bureaucracy.</li>

<h2 id='nara-period-710----794'>Nara Period (710 – 794)</h2>
<h3 id='nara-period'><a href='./blog_posts/nara_blog_post.html'>Nara period</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview &amp; culture:</strong>  Empress <strong>Genmei</strong> moved the capital to <strong>Heijō‑kyō</strong> (Nara), Japan’s first permanent capital laid out in a Chinese‑style grid.  The court attempted greater central control, but heavy taxation, forced labour and primitive tools led to peasant hardship.  <strong>Smallpox epidemics (735–737)</strong> devastated the population, reducing it by <strong>25–35 %</strong>.  <strong>Emperor Shōmu</strong> promoted Buddhism; he ordered provincial temples and built <strong>Tōdai‑ji</strong>, housing a massive <strong>Great Buddha statue</strong>.  Literary works including <strong>Kojiki</strong> (712), <strong>Nihon Shoki</strong> (720) and the <strong>Man’yōshū</strong> poetry collection (c. 760) were compiled.</li>
<li><strong>Important figures:</strong>  Empress <strong>Genmei</strong>, <strong>Emperor Shōmu</strong>, <strong>Fujiwara no Hirotsugu</strong> (rebel), Buddhist monks such as <strong>Gyōki</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Important moments:</strong>  Establishment of Nara as capital; promotion of Buddhism; compilation of Japan’s earliest histories and poetry.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id='heian-period-794----1185'>Heian Period (794 – 1185)</h2>
<h3 id='heian-period'><a href='./blog_posts/heian_blog_post.html'>Heian Period</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview &amp; culture:</strong>  Emperor <strong>Kanmu</strong> moved the capital to <strong>Heian‑kyō (Kyoto)</strong> to escape Buddhist influence.  The <strong>Fujiwara family</strong> dominated politics through regency and marriage alliances; their influence peaked under <strong>Fujiwara no Michinaga</strong>.  Court culture prized aesthetics—<strong>kana</strong> syllabaries allowed Japanese literature such as <strong>Murasaki Shikibu’s Genji Monogatari</strong> and <strong>waka poetry</strong>.  New Buddhist schools <strong>Tendai</strong> (founded by Saichō) and <strong>Shingon</strong> (brought by Kūkai) flourished.  Declining central power and rising warriors led to rivalry between the <strong>Taira</strong> and <strong>Minamoto</strong> clans, culminating in the <strong>Genpei War (1180–1185)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Important figures:</strong>  Emperor <strong>Kanmu</strong>, <strong>Fujiwara no Michinaga</strong>, <strong>Saichō</strong>, <strong>Kūkai</strong>, authors <strong>Murasaki Shikibu</strong> and <strong>Sei Shōnagon</strong>, Taira and Minamoto clan leaders.</li>

<h3 id='kamakura-period'><a href='./blog_posts/kamakura_blog_post.html'>Kamakura period</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview &amp; culture:</strong>  After victory in the <strong>Genpei War</strong>, <strong>Minamoto no Yoritomo</strong> established the <strong>Kamakura shogunate</strong> (1192), making Kamakura the seat of military government.  Power gradually shifted to the <strong>Hōjō regents</strong>.  The law code <strong>Jōei Shikimoku</strong> (1232) codified warrior ethics.  <strong>Zen Buddhism</strong> (introduced by <strong>Eisai</strong> in 1191) and <strong>Nichiren Buddhism</strong> (founded by <strong>Nichiren</strong> in 1253) spread.  The shogunate repelled <strong>Mongol invasion attempts</strong> in <strong>1274</strong> and <strong>1281</strong>; typhoons (“kamikaze”) destroyed the Mongol fleets.  Internal unrest and imperial restoration attempts led to the fall of the Kamakura government in 1333.</li>
<li><strong>Important figures:</strong>  <strong>Minamoto no Yoritomo</strong>, <strong>Hōjō Masako</strong> and Hōjō regents, <strong>Eisai</strong>, <strong>Nichiren</strong>, <strong>Emperor Go‑Daigo</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Important moments:</strong>  Establishment of the shogunate; introduction of Zen and Nichiren Buddhism; repelling Mongol invasions; codification of samurai law.</li>

<h3 id='muromachi-ashikaga-period-7-sengoku-era'><a href='./blog_posts/muromachi_blog_post.html'>Muromachi (Ashikaga) period 7 Sengoku Era</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview &amp; culture:</strong>  After <strong>Ashikaga Takauji</strong> seized power, the shogunate moved to Kyoto’s <strong>Muromachi district</strong>.  This era was marked by weak central control and incessant warfare among <strong>daimyō</strong>.  Cultural achievements included the construction of <strong>Kinkaku‑ji</strong> (Golden Pavilion) and <strong>Ginkaku‑ji</strong> (Silver Pavilion) and the popularization of the <strong>tea ceremony</strong>, flower arranging and <strong>Noh theatre</strong>.  The <strong>Onin War (1467–1477)</strong> erupted over a succession dispute; bitter rivalry between the <strong>Hosokawa</strong> and <strong>Yamana</strong> clans drew in many others and devastated Kyoto.  The conflict marked the start of the <strong>Sengoku (“Warring States”) period</strong> (c. 1467–1568) when warlords fought for dominance.</li>
<li><strong>Important figures:</strong>  <strong>Ashikaga Takauji</strong>, later shoguns (Yoshimitsu, Yoshimasa); cultural patrons such as <strong>Murata Shukō</strong> (tea ceremony); warlords of the Sengoku era including <strong>Hosokawa Katsumoto</strong>, <strong>Yamana Sōzen</strong>.</li>

<h2 id='azuchi--momoyama-period-15681573----1600'>Azuchi–Momoyama Period (1568/1573 – 1600)</h2>
<h3 id='azuchi-momoyama-period'><a href='./blog_posts/azuchi_blog_post.html'>Azuchi-Momoyama period</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview &amp; culture:</strong>  The warlord <a href='./blog_posts/oda_nobunaga_blog_post.html'><strong>Oda Nobunaga</strong></a> seized Kyoto in <strong>1568</strong> and embarked on unifying Japan.  He <strong>destroyed militant Buddhist sects</strong> and defeated the Takeda clan at the <strong>Battle of Nagashino (1575)</strong>.  After Nobunaga’s death in <strong>1582</strong>, his general <strong>Toyotomi Hideyoshi</strong> continued the unification.  Hideyoshi enacted the <strong>“sword hunt”</strong> (1588) to disarm peasants and ordered a <strong>census and land survey</strong>; he restricted social mobility and persecuted Christian missionaries (executing 26 martyrs in 1597).  Hideyoshi launched costly invasions of <strong>Korea</strong> (1592–1598).  After his death (1598), power struggles culminated in the <strong>Battle of Sekigahara (1600)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Important figures:</strong>  <a href='./blog_posts/oda_nobunaga_blog_post.html'><strong>Oda Nobunaga</strong></a>, <strong>Toyotomi Hideyoshi</strong>, <strong>Tokugawa Ieyasu</strong> (emerged victorious at Sekigahara).</li>

<h3 id='edo-tokugawa-period'><a href='./blog_posts/edo_blog_post.html'>Edo (Tokugawa) period</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview &amp; culture:</strong>  After his victory at <strong>Sekigahara</strong>, <strong>Tokugawa Ieyasu</strong> became shogun in <strong>1603</strong>.  The Tokugawa shogunate imposed a rigid social hierarchy and required daimyō to maintain <strong>alternate attendance</strong> in Edo.  <strong>Tokugawa Iemitsu</strong> instituted the <strong>sakoku</strong> isolation policy (1633‑1639), limiting foreign trade to Nagasaki.  The <strong>Genroku era</strong> (1688‑1703) saw flourishing urban culture (kabuki, ukiyo‑e).  Over time the regime faced financial strain, famines and peasant unrest.  In <strong>1853–54</strong> Commodore <strong>Matthew Perry</strong> forced Japan to open its ports; internal dissent led to the fall of the shogunate in <strong>1867</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Important figures:</strong>  <strong>Tokugawa Ieyasu</strong>, <strong>Tokugawa Iemitsu</strong>, scholars and artists such as <strong>Chikamatsu Monzaemon</strong> (playwright) and <strong>Hokusai</strong> (artist), <strong>Commodore Perry</strong>.</li>

The new government rapidly <strong>modernised</strong>: it abolished the feudal class system, established <strong>universal education</strong>, built railways and factories, and adopted Western technology.  The 1889 <strong>Meiji Constitution</strong> created a parliament (Diet) while affirming imperial sovereignty.  Japan pursued imperialism, winning the <strong>First Sino‑Japanese War (1894‑1895)</strong> and the <strong>Russo‑Japanese War (1904‑1905)</strong> and annexing <strong>Korea</strong> in 1910.</li>
