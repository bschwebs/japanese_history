                <h5 class="card-title">Introduction</h5>
                <p class="card-text">If Japanese history had a rock-and-roll hall of fame, <strong>Oda Nobunaga</strong> would have his own wing — complete with a gold-leaf war helmet, a smoking matchlock gun, and maybe a half-burned Buddhist monastery. Born in 1534, Nobunaga wasn’t just another samurai lord clawing for power in the chaotic Sengoku (“Warring States”) period; he was the guy who walked into a fractured, war-torn Japan and thought, &quot;You know what this place needs? A full-blown unification… and some firearms for extra spice.&quot;</p>
                <p class="card-text">The man was equal parts visionary, ruthless tactician, and cultural innovator. If <strong>Toyotomi Hideyoshi</strong> was the master builder and Tokugawa Ieyasu the careful consolidator, Nobunaga was the demolition expert who cleared the lot.</p>

            <div class="card-body">
                <h5 class="card-title">Early Life: The Fool of Owari</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Nobunaga was born in Owari Province (modern-day Aichi Prefecture) in 1534, the son of Oda Nobuhide, a minor daimyo with big dreams. Young Nobunaga didn’t exactly make the best impression as a future leader. He had a reputation for eccentric, even bizarre behavior — dressing in shabby clothes, mingling with commoners, and staging what some of his contemporaries considered juvenile stunts. Locals dubbed him Owari no Utsuke, “The Fool of Owari.”</p>
                <p class="card-text">But the “fool” had a mind like a steel trap. His unorthodox habits were less about incompetence and more about defying stale samurai etiquette. Where other lords followed rigid codes, Nobunaga seemed to say, &quot;Why follow rules written by people who are dead? Let’s make new ones.&quot;</p>

            <div class="card-body">
                <h5 class="card-title">Rise to Power: Guns, Guts, and Gekokujo</h5>
                <p class="card-text">In the 1550s, Japan was a patchwork of feuding domains. This was the age of gekokujo, “the low overcoming the high,” where ambitious upstarts could topple their betters through cunning or sheer audacity.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Nobunaga’s breakthrough came at the Battle of Okehazama in 1560. <strong>Facing Imagawa Yoshimoto</strong> — a rival with roughly three times the troops — Nobunaga pulled off one of the great ambushes in military history. Using the cover of a sudden thunderstorm, his small force struck directly at Yoshimoto’s camp, killing him and scattering his army. It was a textbook case of speed, deception, and nerves of steel.</p>
                <p class="card-text">This victory instantly catapulted Nobunaga into the national spotlight. In an era where power came from both the sword and the story, Nobunaga had just written himself into legend.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="card mb-2">
            <div class="card-body">
                <h5 class="card-title">The Road to Unification</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Nobunaga’s goal wasn’t to just survive — it was to unify Japan under his banner. He allied himself with the 15th Ashikaga shogun, <strong>Ashikaga Yoshiaki</strong>, in 1568, marching into Kyoto to “restore” the shogunate. In reality, Yoshiaki quickly found himself more puppet than partner, and by 1573, Nobunaga had him deposed, effectively ending the Ashikaga shogunate altogether.</p>
                <p class="card-text">From there, it was a campaign of relentless military innovation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Firearms: Nobunaga embraced the arquebus (a matchlock gun introduced by the Portuguese) like no other. At the Battle of Nagashino in 1575, he famously deployed ranks of gunners behind wooden palisades to mow down the feared Takeda cavalry. It was one of the first large-scale, effective uses of volley fire in Japan.</li>
                    <li>Castle Design: He transformed fortifications from simple mountaintop keeps into sprawling, multi-functional castles like Azuchi, which doubled as political centers and symbols of authority.</li>
                    <li>Infrastructure: Nobunaga encouraged trade, standardized markets, and worked to free merchants from the oppressive toll systems imposed by local lords.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="card mb-2">
            <div class="card-body">
                <h5 class="card-title">The Ruthless Side: No Room for Rivals</h5>
                <p class="card-text">If Nobunaga had a weakness, it was his zero-tolerance policy toward opposition. He was not the type to negotiate endlessly; he preferred a swift and decisive end to conflict — often at great cost to his enemies.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Perhaps the most infamous example was his 1571 attack on the Enryaku-ji monastery on Mount Hiei. The warrior monks had defied him one too many times, and Nobunaga’s response was to burn the complex to the ground, killing thousands. To modern sensibilities, it was brutal; to Nobunaga, it was a message: Resist, and you will be erased.</p>
                <p class="card-text">He also crushed the Ikkō-ikki — leagues of militant Buddhist peasants and monks — in a series of bloody campaigns. While these moves eliminated threats to his power, they also cemented his reputation as a fearsome and often merciless ruler.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="card mb-2">
            <div class="card-body">
                <h5 class="card-title">Cultural Patron and Modernizer</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Despite his ruthlessness on the battlefield, Nobunaga had a surprisingly sophisticated cultural side. He welcomed foreign traders and missionaries, allowing Christianity to gain a foothold in Japan (though not necessarily out of piety — he liked the European goods and tech that came with them). Jesuit missionaries described him as curious and open-minded, though skeptical of religious dogma.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Nobunaga also patronized the arts, particularly the tea ceremony, Noh theater, and lavish architectural projects. His Azuchi Castle, built on the shores of Lake Biwa, was a marvel of the age — an ornate, multi-story keep decorated with gold and intricate paintings, visible for miles as a symbol of his power.</p>

        <div class="card mb-2">
            <div class="card-body">
                <h5 class="card-title">The Fall: Honnō-ji Incident, 1582</h5>
                <p class="card-text">For all his brilliance, Nobunaga’s career ended abruptly and violently. In June 1582, while staying at the Honnō-ji temple in Kyoto with only a small retinue, he was betrayed by one of his top generals, Akechi Mitsuhide.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Mitsuhide’s motives remain debated: personal grudges, political ambition, or fear of Nobunaga’s growing dominance. Whatever the cause, he attacked in the early morning hours. Caught off guard and vastly outnumbered, Nobunaga chose not to be captured. He committed seppuku (ritual suicide), and the temple was set ablaze.</p>
                <p class="card-text">His death shocked Japan. Though his campaigns had been incomplete, Nobunaga had already transformed the political landscape. Within two decades, his allies <strong>Toyotomi Hideyoshi</strong> and <strong>Tokugawa Ieyasu</strong> would finish the work he began.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Legacy</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Nobunaga’s legacy is one of contrasts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unifier and Destroyer: He tore down centuries-old institutions but laid the groundwork for national unity.</li>
                    <li>Tyrant and Visionary: He could be merciless in war, yet forward-thinking in governance and culture.</li>
                    <li>Traditional Samurai and Modern Innovator: He mastered the sword but embraced the gun, symbolizing Japan’s transition from medieval to early modern warfare.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="card-text">He is remembered in countless plays, novels, video games, and dramas as a larger-than-life figure — sometimes as a hero, sometimes as a villain, always as a force of nature.</p>

                <p class="card-text">“If the cuckoo won’t sing, kill it.”Part of a famous trio of sayings comparing Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and Ieyasu. Nobunaga’s version reflects decisiveness (and perhaps ruthlessness).</p>
                <p class="card-text">“Tenka Fubu” — “Rule the realm by force.”His personal motto, emblazoned on banners, captured his philosophy of swift, overwhelming action.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Conclusion</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Oda Nobunaga was the spark that set Japan’s unification ablaze. He didn’t live to see the nation fully brought under a single rule, but without his military genius, daring reforms, and sheer audacity, the path to unity might have taken far longer — or not happened at all.</p>
                <p class="card-text">History remembers him as both a demon king and a brilliant reformer. Perhaps that’s fitting. After all, to change a world, you have to be willing to burn away the old — sometimes literally.</p>
