<p><img src="./img/asuka_prince_shotoku.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Prince Shotoku"></p>
<p>After journeying through the tumultuous and colourful chapters of Japan’s history — from the hunter‑gatherer artisans of the Jōmon age to the fragile democracy of Taishō and beyond — it’s easy to view the Asuka period as a blur of court intrigues and imported ideas.  Yet nestled within that era is a single figure who seems to stride across centuries, shaping the foundations of the Japanese state while earning a reputation as both statesman and saint.  <strong>Prince Shōtoku</strong>, regent, reformer and philosopher, is the man who did for ancient Japan what Steve Jobs did for smartphones: he didn’t invent the pieces, but he put them together in ways that transformed society.  This post dives into his life, family and legacy, exploring why a prince who never took the throne still commands such reverence.</p>
<h2 id='a-horsestable-birth-and-imperial-lineage'>A Horse‑Stable Birth and Imperial Lineage</h2>
<p>If his supporters are to be believed, Shōtoku’s life began with a flourish worthy of mythology.  According to later chronicles, his mother, Princess Anahobe no Hashihito, went into labour while making rounds of the palace and gave birth in the doorway of a horse stable.  Hence his childhood name <strong>Umayado</strong> (literally “Prince of the Horse Stable”).  Legend aside, what we do know is that he was born in <strong>574 CE</strong> as the second son of <strong>Emperor Yōmei</strong> and a member of the powerful Soga clan through his mother.  The Soga dominated court politics in the late sixth century, and their influence would prove decisive in Shōtoku’s rise.  He was also a nephew of <strong>Empress Suiko</strong>, his aunt, who later ruled in her own right.  As an aristocratic child, he received a Confucian and Buddhist education and was reputedly precocious; some stories claim he could speak from birth or hold audiences with ten people at once — tall tales perhaps, but they hint at the aura that quickly grew around him.</p>
<h2 id='power-struggles-and-a-young-regent'>Power Struggles and a Young Regent</h2>
<p>Politics in late‑Asuka Japan were not for the faint‑hearted.  When Emperor Yōmei died in 587, rival clans vied for succession, culminating in a battle between the pro‑Buddhist <strong>Soga</strong> and the traditionalist <strong>Mononobe</strong> faction.  Shōtoku sided with his Soga relatives.  He is said to have prayed to the Four Heavenly Kings for victory and, following the Soga triumph, donated Mononobe estates to the Hōryū‑ji temple.  The conflict paved the way for Soga no Umako, leader of the clan, to place his niece <strong>Suiko</strong> on the throne.  In <strong>593</strong>, barely twenty years old, Shōtoku was appointed <strong>regent</strong> to govern on her behalf.  The appointment was politically shrewd: as a male of imperial blood with Soga backing, he could stabilise court politics while allowing the Soga to remain kingmakers.  He would hold the regency until his death in <strong>622</strong>, effectively steering the state for three decades.</p>
<h3 id='meritocracy-by-fashion-the-twelvelevel-cap-and-rank-system'>Meritocracy by Fashion: The Twelve‑Level Cap and Rank System</h3>
<p>One of Shōtoku’s first major acts was to overhaul the aristocratic pecking order.  In <strong>604</strong>, he introduced a <strong>twelve‑level cap and rank system</strong> that assigned coloured headgear to officials according to their virtue and ability rather than their clan.  Caps ranged from deep purple for “Greater Virtue” to black for “Lesser Knowledge,” borrowing the Confucian virtues of benevolence, decorum, fidelity, righteousness and wisdom.  Promotions were based on merit, and the emperor alone granted ranks.  This may sound like ancient HR admin, but it was revolutionary.  It weakened hereditary titles, emphasised loyalty to the sovereign and created a rudimentary bureaucracy — all while turning the court into the world’s first colour‑coordinated corporate ladder.  Shōtoku also removed the right of regional leaders to levy taxes and introduced a Chinese‑style calendar, further centralising authority.</p>
<h3 id='the-seventeenarticle-constitution-a-moral-blueprint'>The Seventeen‑Article Constitution: A Moral Blueprint</h3>
<p>Shōtoku is most famous for his <strong>Seventeen‑Article Constitution</strong>, promulgated in <strong>604</strong>.  Rather than a legal code, this document is a set of moral precepts aimed at harmonising court society.  It is steeped in <strong>Buddhist and Confucian ideals</strong>, emphasising harmony (<em>wa</em>), obedience to imperial authority and ethical behaviour.  Early articles stress the cosmic hierarchy: “When you receive the imperial commands, fail not to obey them scrupulously.  The lord is heaven; the vassal is earth.  Heaven overspreads, and earth bears up… When the lord speaks, the vassal listens.”  Later articles admonish ministers to make “decorous behaviour their leading principle,” to “deal impartially” with lawsuits and to work hard — “attend the court early in the morning and retire late.”  The final article reminds officials that important decisions should not be made by one person alone but deliberated collectively.  Though scholars debate whether Shōtoku personally authored the document, its philosophy reflects his vision: a centralised state guided by morality and consensus.</p>
<h2 id='patron-of-buddhism-and-builder-of-temples'>Patron of Buddhism and Builder of Temples</h2>
<p>Born to devout parents, Shōtoku was deeply influenced by <strong>Buddhism</strong>.  When he became regent he issued an edict promoting the faith and encouraged the construction of temples.  In <strong>593</strong> he founded <strong>Shitenno‑ji</strong> in Osaka to commemorate the Soga victory, followed by <strong>Hōkō‑ji</strong> (596) and <strong>Hōryū‑ji</strong> (607).  Hōryū‑ji, rebuilt after a fire in 670, still stands today and is the world’s oldest surviving wooden temple complex.  During his regency <strong>46 monasteries and temples</strong> were constructed.  Shōtoku personally studied Buddhist scriptures and wrote commentaries on the <strong>Lotus Sutra</strong>, the <strong>Vimalakīrti Sutra</strong> and the <strong>Śrīmālādevī Sutra</strong>.  Article II of his constitution urges officials to “revere the three treasures” — Buddha, Dharma and Sangha — as final refuge.  His patronage not only nurtured Japanese Buddhism but also enhanced the emperor’s spiritual prestige, providing a religious underpinning for the state.</p>
<h2 id='envoys-chronicles-and-a-look-beyond-japan'>Envoys, Chronicles and a Look Beyond Japan</h2>
<p>Shōtoku understood that Japan could not thrive in isolation.  In <strong>600</strong>, he resumed sending official envoys to <strong>China</strong>, a practice neglected for decades.  The most famous embassy departed in <strong>607</strong>, led by Ono no Imoko, bearing a message from the “ruler of the land of the rising sun to the emperor of the land of the setting sun” — diplomatic phrasing that risked offending the Sui court but boldly asserted Japan’s equality.  These missions imported Chinese <strong>arts, craftsmen, monks and bureaucratic knowledge</strong>.  They also set the stage for later envoys who returned with ideas that informed the <strong>Taika Reforms</strong> of 645.  Shōtoku’s interest in history and legitimacy led him, together with Soga no Umako, to compile two chronicles, the <strong>Tennōki</strong> (“Record of Emperors”) and <strong>Kokki</strong> (“National Record”), which were among Japan’s earliest historical texts.  Although the manuscripts were later burned during a coup, their existence underscores his desire to document and legitimise imperial authority.</p>
<h2 id='personal-life-and-immediate-family'>Personal Life and Immediate Family</h2>
<p>Beyond politics and religion, Shōtoku’s personal life reflects the complexity of Asuka society.  He married at least one consort, believed to be Princess <strong>Toji</strong> (some sources name her as <strong>Princess Tachibana no Kashihade</strong>), and had children, including <strong>Prince Yamashiro no Ōe</strong>, who later fought unsuccessfully for the throne.  His family ties were a tapestry of powerful clans: his father Emperor Yōmei was part of the imperial lineage, while his mother belonged to the Soga clan, giving him a foot in both the imperial and aristocratic camps.  His aunt Empress Suiko relied on him to administer the state.  These relationships allowed him to act as a bridge between clans, using his lineage to curb factionalism and promote centralisation.</p>
<h2 id='withdrawal-from-politics-and-final-years'>Withdrawal from Politics and Final Years</h2>
<p>After decades of service, Shōtoku grew disillusioned with court intrigues.  In his later years he withdrew from active politics to the palace at <strong>Ikaruga</strong>, adjacent to Hōryū‑ji.  A famous saying attributed to him captures his spiritual turn: “This world is empty and false; Buddha alone is real.”  Whether he actually uttered these words is uncertain, but they express the Buddhist emphasis on impermanence that he championed.  Prince Shōtoku died on <strong>8 April 622</strong>, at the age of 48.  The <em>Nihon Shoki</em> (Chronicles of Japan) records that his death plunged the nation into mourning: farmers dropped their ploughs, women their pestles, and people exclaimed that “the sun and moon have lost their brightness.”  Empress Suiko continued to rule, and Shōtoku’s son Yamashiro briefly attempted to carry on his father’s work, but it was the later <strong>Taika Reforms</strong> that fully realised many of his ambitions.</p>
<h2 id='legacy-saint-statesman-and-cultural-icon'>Legacy: Saint, Statesman and Cultural Icon</h2>
<p>In the centuries after his death, a <strong>cult of Shōtoku</strong> flourished.  He was venerated as a guardian of good government and even regarded as an incarnation of the Bodhisattva <strong>Kannon</strong>.  During the Kamakura period his portraits adorned temples; in modern times his likeness has appeared on Japanese banknotes.  Historians such as W. G. Beasley note that his reforms set aspirations that became orthodox in court politics and, by sending students to China, he enabled successors to deepen their understanding of Chinese governance.  The cap and rank system foreshadowed the <strong>ritsuryō</strong> bureaucracy of the Nara period.  His constitution, with its calls for harmony and collective decision‑making, influenced later legal codes and remains quoted in civics textbooks.  His promotion of Buddhism laid the groundwork for its integration into state ideology.  And his willingness to adopt foreign ideas while asserting Japan’s dignity prefigured the country’s later patterns of selective borrowing.</p>
<h2 id='why-prince-shōtoku-still-matters'>Why Prince Shōtoku Still Matters</h2>
<p>Studying Prince Shōtoku is like examining the DNA of the Japanese state.  His policies reveal how early Japan grappled with the tension between clan power and imperial authority, between local customs and foreign models.  His embrace of meritocracy over hereditary privilege hints at a proto‑modern mindset.  His constitution’s emphasis on deliberation over unilateral action could serve as a reminder for modern leaders addicted to executive orders.  His call to “revere the three treasures” speaks to the enduring importance of spiritual values in public life, while his own disenchantment reminds us that politics often leads to spiritual searching.  Even his fashion reforms — colour‑coded caps based on Confucian virtues — feel surprisingly contemporary in an era of branded office lanyards.
And let’s not forget the humour in the story.  A prince born in a horse stable grows up to manage a stable of ministers; an aristocrat who codifies a dress code that would make any corporate HR department proud; a regent who writes what may be the earliest Japanese constitution yet ends up on a banknote.  His life offers drama, philosophy and the occasional chuckle, making him a perfect subject for our ongoing exploration of Japan’s past.  So the next time you hear someone say “harmony is of the most importance,” know that behind those words stands a prince who balanced power and principle with remarkable finesse.</p>
