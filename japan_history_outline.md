# Historical Outline of Japan by Era

## Jōmon Period (c. 14,500 BCE – c. 300 BCE)

- **Overview & culture:**  Japan’s earliest known culture was the hunter‑gatherer **Jōmon** people.  The name *Jōmon* means *“cord‑marked”* and refers to the distinctive pottery patterns【91324256366745†L87-L103】.  They lived in pit dwellings and relied on fishing, hunting and foraging.  Around **900 BCE** rice farming was introduced, marking a gradual shift toward agriculture【91324256366745†L111-L117】.  Population expanded and by c. 3,000 BCE there were possibly hundreds of thousands of people【91324256366745†L130-L136】.
- **Important figures:**  No specific rulers are recorded for this prehistoric era.
- **Notable events:**  Development of cord‑marked pottery; introduction of rudimentary agriculture toward the end of the period【91324256366745†L111-L117】.
- **Tragedies:**  Evidence of natural disasters exists in the archaeological record (tsunami deposits), but no documented tragedies.

## Yayoi Period (c. 300 BCE – c. 250 CE)

Stone tools were gradually replaced by bronze and iron implements, irrigation techniques were developed and communal granaries appeared【374466038833820†L87-L116】.

## Kofun Period (c. 250 – 538)

- **Overview & culture:**  Named after the **kofun** (large earthen burial mounds), this era marks the rise of the **Yamato clan**, who established control over central Japan and later formed the imperial lineage.  **Shinto** beliefs emerged and elaborate **haniwa** clay figures were placed around tombs【566552861036243†L86-L90】【566552861036243†L95-L105】.

After **Fujiwara no Kamatari** launched a coup in **645**, the **Taika Reforms** nationalised land and restructured administration along Chinese lines【281801154756444†L124-L136】.  The period ended following the **Jinshin Incident** (671–672), when **Emperor Tenmu** purged rivals to secure succession【281801154756444†L144-L149】.

The court attempted greater central control, but heavy taxation, forced labour and primitive tools led to peasant hardship【322537744012736†L295-L300】.  **Smallpox epidemics (735–737)** devastated the population, reducing it by **25–35 %**【322537744012736†L310-L318】.  **Emperor Shōmu** promoted Buddhism; he ordered provincial temples and built **Tōdai‑ji**, housing a massive **Great Buddha statue**【322537744012736†L330-L334】.  Literary works including **Kojiki** (712), **Nihon Shoki** (720) and the **Man’yōshū** poetry collection (c. 760) were compiled【322537744012736†L344-L352】【322537744012736†L345-L356】.

The **Fujiwara family** dominated politics through regency and marriage alliances; their influence peaked under **Fujiwara no Michinaga**.  Court culture prized aesthetics—**kana** syllabaries allowed Japanese literature such as **Murasaki Shikibu’s Genji Monogatari** and **waka poetry**【459199794179205†L379-L388】.  New Buddhist schools **Tendai** (founded by Saichō) and **Shingon** (brought by Kūkai) flourished【459199794179205†L403-L411】.  Declining central power and rising warriors led to rivalry between the **Taira** and **Minamoto** clans, culminating in the **Genpei War (1180–1185)**【459199794179205†L425-L436】.

Power gradually shifted to the **Hōjō regents**.  The law code **Jōei Shikimoku** (1232) codified warrior ethics【985114909720504†L30-L83】.  **Zen Buddhism** (introduced by **Eisai** in 1191) and **Nichiren Buddhism** (founded by **Nichiren** in 1253) spread【985114909720504†L30-L83】.  The shogunate repelled **Mongol invasion attempts** in **1274** and **1281**; typhoons (“kamikaze”) destroyed the Mongol fleets【985114909720504†L30-L83】.  Internal unrest and imperial restoration attempts led to the fall of the Kamakura government in 1333【985114909720504†L30-L83】.

The **Onin War (1467–1477)** erupted over a succession dispute; bitter rivalry between the **Hosokawa** and **Yamana** clans drew in many others and devastated Kyoto.  The conflict marked the start of the **Sengoku (“Warring States”) period** (c. 1467–1568) when warlords fought for dominance【347769293819611†L268-L301】.

After Nobunaga’s death in **1582**, his general **Toyotomi Hideyoshi** continued the unification.

The **Genroku era** (1688‑1703) saw flourishing urban culture (kabuki, ukiyo‑e).  Over time the regime faced financial strain, famines and peasant unrest.  In **1853–54** Commodore **Matthew Perry** forced Japan to open its ports; internal dissent led to the fall of the shogunate in **1867**【367158959281636†L29-L109】.
